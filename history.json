One of the most memorable events in my life happened three years ago because of the climate. It was during the rainy season in my town. Usually, it rains a little every day, but that year was different.\nFor one whole week, the rain didn’t stop. The streets were full of water, and people had to walk carefully. Some shops were closed, and schools didn’t open for two days. Everyone was worried because the river was rising very fast.\nThen, on Friday morning, the rain finally stopped. The sun came out, and the air felt fresh and cool. People came out of their houses to clean the streets and talk with their neighbors. In the afternoon, a big rainbow appeared across the sky. It was the most beautiful rainbow I had ever seen!\nThat day was unforgettable for me. Even though the week was difficult, it brought people together.
